# safe2school

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of safe2school is to form a basis for reproducible analysis of open data to estimate current levels of, and estimates of future potential for, active travel to schools, anywhere in the world, down to the street level.
The motivation is well documented: active travel is an effective solution to environmental, health and social issues.
Specifically, there is a crisis of sedentary lifestyles affecting young people worldwide.
Building active travel into everyday life can mitigate this crisis and lead to better mental health and educational outcomes, and tackle inequalities that are exacerbated by the transport system.

By active travel we mean school pupils 'moving on their own steam' by one of the following modes of transport:

-   Walking
-   Wheeling, which can include scooting, rollerblading, or even skatingboarding
-   Biking, using a pedal cycle
-   Ebiking, using a pedal cycle with electric assist (aka pedelec)

There is a substantial body of research on active travel among young people and 'safe routes to school' in particular.
However, the relevance of much of research for local transport planners tasked with prioritising interventions in specific locations is limited because results are rarely provided at the street level at which local infrastructure decisions, such as improving sidewalks or creating new protected cycles, are made.

One approach that does provide local results, and which is used by transport planners in cities across England, is the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT).
First developed in 2015, the approach was extended in 2018 to estimate cycling potential to schools across England @goodman_scenarios_2019. The results are publicly available nationwide via an interactive web application hosted at [www.pct.bike](https://www.pct.bike/), as shown in the image below for London, UK.

Problems associated with the 'PCT approach' represented in the image above include:

-   It is very focussed on data from one place, England, and is therefore not easily applicable to other countries or cities worldwide.

-   It relies on origin-destination data *with estimates of mode split per OD pair,* something that is unfortunately not available in most places; mode of travel to school is rarely recorded and is seldom available at the OD level when it is.

-   Furthermore, in many cases OD data representing travel to school is not available at all.

In many cases, especially in contexts where local or national governments are undertaking research to support effective interventions, OD datasets are available but these cannot be shared.
This makes any derived outputs subject to the same potentially strict licensing agreements that apply to the OD data, preventing the data from being used by a broad range of stakeholders including parents, head teachers, advocacy groups and consultancies.
Yet making the results of transport models open is key to their impact @lovelace_open_2020.

The good news is that more datasets are available than ever before that can be used to inform sustainable transport policies, plans and decision-making.
OpenStreetMap data, which is contributed by the community and free for non-commercial use worldwide, contains information on most significant schools, roads, walkways and cycleways in many cities.
There are many other datasets that can be used to support evidence-based transport planning in general and prioritisation of safe routes to school in particular, including:

-   Count datasets, for example cycle counters on roads that feed local schools

-   Crash datasets, for example recording slight, serious and fatal injuries at high spatial and temporal resolution

-   Socio-demographic data

However, the focus of this paper is on OSM data because it is so widely available.
It is hoped that work building on this foundation will demonstrate how to incorporate other datasets into the analysis, for example as the basis of research into inequalities in road safety outcomes @vidaltortosa_socioeconomic_2021.

The code below demonstrates the potential for reproducible research based on open source software to estimate travel to school patterns and walking, wheeling and cycling potential.
